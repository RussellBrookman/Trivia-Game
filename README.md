# Trivia-Game

This is a basic trivia game. It will tell you when you have an answer wrong or right. If you have an an answer wrong it will tell you the right one. It has a timer posting a countdown clock. If time counts out your answer is counted as wrong. Finally, it keeps track of your score so it can tell you how well you did at the end of the game. After that it askes you to play again which resets the game and the score variable. I built this with JavaScript logic, jQuery, and with very little CSS.
